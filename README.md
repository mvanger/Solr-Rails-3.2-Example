Solr PDF Search Example in Rails 3.2
============

I spent the majority of a day bashing my head into a wall trying to get Solr working to index PDF files with Rails. I am not a Java developer, so groking the documentation around the Apache Solr stuff was a bit difficult. 20 different blog posts all said slightly different things and didn't point out the pitfalls. 

This example application will get you up and running with Solr working for PDF indexing.
